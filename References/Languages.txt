This document contains notes on languages.

The PHB broadly classifies languages into Standard and Exotic

At this point, we will only allow standard languages

We have reclassified Draconic as a standard language and Giant as an Exotic language

Standard Languages for our purposes:
Common
Draconic
Dwarvish
Elvish
Gnomish
Goblin
Halfling
Orc


Exotic languages (not included in beta):
Abyssal
Celestial
Deep Speech
Giant
Infernal
Primordial
Sylvan
Undercommon


For our purposes, it will be assumed that if someone can speak a language they can also read it
according to PHB, all standard languages use dwarvish script except common and halfling (common script) and elvish (elvish script)

Every character must speak common, unless the character is rendered illiterate by low intelligence (not allowed in beta)

Thieves Cant is not considered a language, although it should eventually be implemented through this system

Players cannot learn or forget languages in this version
