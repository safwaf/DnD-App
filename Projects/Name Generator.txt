Name Generator program

The name generator is a function that will accept an integer (signifying which race the character is) and a boolean (signifying the gender of the character)

Using the name tables provided in the PHB, the function will randomly select an appropriate name for that gender and race

Will be incorporated into a future version of the character creator
